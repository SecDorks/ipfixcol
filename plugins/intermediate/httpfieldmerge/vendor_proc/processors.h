 * \brief IPFIXcol 'httpfieldmerge' intermediate plugin.
 *
 * Intermediate plugin for IPFIXcol that merges HTTP-related fields from various vendors
 * into one unified set, such that analysis applications can always rely on the unified
 * set of fields. The following fields are currently supported:
 *
 *     - HTTP hostname
 *     - HTTP URL
 *     - HTTP user agent (UA)
 *
 * Specifically, this plugin performs only a single task:
 *
 *     - Replace the IE definitions of HTTP-related fields with those of the unified
 *          set of fields. As such, only templates are modified (and data records are
 *          not).
 *
 * HTTP-related fields from the following vendors are currently supported:
 *
 *     - Cisco,                 PEN: 9
 *     - Masaryk University,    PEN: 16982
 *     - INVEA-TECH,            PEN: 39499
 *     - ntop,                  PEN: 35632
 *
 * The unified set of fields uses PEN '44913'.
