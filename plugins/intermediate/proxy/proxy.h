 * \brief IPFIXcol 'proxy' intermediate plugin.
 *
 * Intermediate plugin for IPFIXcol that 'translates' flows related to Web proxies,
 * useful for monitoring applications that need to be aware of the real hosts 'behind'
 * the proxy. If this plugin is not used, all HTTP(S) flows will have the Web proxy as
 * their source or destination. Specifically, this plugin performs the following tasks:
 * 
 *     - Add 'original' fields to both template and data records.
 *     - In case the Web proxy is the source of a flow, both the source IPv4/IPv6
 *         address and port number are copied to the 'original' fields. In case the
 *         Web proxy is the destination of a flow, both the destination IPv4/IPv6
 *         address and port number are copied to the 'original' fields.
 *     - The HTTP host and/or URL are used to resolve the IP address of the 'real'
 *         host 'behind' the proxy. Only the first result of the domain name resolution
 *         is used.
 *     - The IP address obtained by domain name resolution and port are placed in the
 *         IPv4/IPv6 address and port number fields, respectively.
 *
 * The enterprise-specific IEs are added to template/data records in the following order
 * (per IP version):
 *
 *      <src_port, src_IP_addr, dst_port, dst_IP_addr>
 *
 * In case a template/data record features both IPv4 and IPv6 IEs, the port number IEs
 * are added only once (together with the IPv4 IEs), to avoid template/data records that
 * feature multiple instances of the same IE.
